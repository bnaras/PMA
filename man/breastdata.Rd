\title{Breast cancer gene expression + DNA copy number data set from Chin
et. al. and used in Witten, et. al. See references below.}
\format{
The format is a list containing the following elements: - dna: a
2149x89 matrix of CGH spots x Samples - rna: a 19672x89 matrix of Genes x
Samples - chrom: a 2149-vector of chromosomal location of each CGH spot -
nuc: a 2149-vector of nucleotide position for each CGH spot - gene: a
19672-vector wiith an accession number for each gene - genenames: a
19672-vector with a name for each gene - genechr: a 19672-vector with a
chromosomal location for each gene - genedesc: a 19672-vector with a
description for each gene - genepos: a 19672-vector with a nucleotide
position for each gene
}
\description{
This data set consists of gene expression and DNA copy number
measurements on a set of 89 samples. The data set can be used to
perform integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA copy number
data, as in . That is,
we can look for sets of genes that are associated with regions of
chromosomal gain/loss.

\details{
Missing values were imputed using 5-nearest neighbors (see library
\code{pamr}).
