\title{Perform cross-validation on sparse principal component analysis}
\usage{
SPC.cv(
  x,
  sumabsvs = seq(1.2, 5, len = 10),
  nfolds = 5,
  niter = 5,
  v = NULL,
  trace = TRUE,
  orth = FALSE,
  center = TRUE,
  vpos = FALSE,
  vneg = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data matrix of dimension $n x p$, which can contain NA for missing
values. We are interested in finding sparse principal components of
dimension $p$.}

\item{sumabsvs}{Range of sumabsv values to be considered in
cross-validation. Sumabsv is the sum of absolute values of elements of v. It
must be between 1 and square root of number of columns of data. The smaller
it is, the sparser v will be.}

\item{nfolds}{Number of cross-validation folds performed.}

\item{niter}{How many iterations should be performed. By default, perform
only 5 for speed reasons.}

\item{v}{The first right singular vector(s) of the data. (If missing data is
present, then the missing values are imputed before the singular vectors are
calculated.) v is used as the initial value for the iterative PMD($L_1$,
$L_1$) algorithm. If x is large, then this step can be time-consuming;
therefore, if PMD is to be run multiple times, then v should be computed
once and saved.}

\item{trace}{Print out progress as iterations are performed? Default is
TRUE.}

\item{orth}{If TRUE, then use method of Section 3.2 of Witten, Tibshirani
and Hastie (2008) to obtain multiple sparse principal components. Default is
FALSE.}

\item{center}{Subtract out mean of x? Default is TRUE}

\item{vpos}{Constrain elements of v to be positive? Default is FALSE.}

\item{vneg}{Constrain elements of v to be negative? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
\item{cv}{Average sum of squared errors that results for each tuning
parameter value.} \item{cv.error}{Standard error of the average sum of
squared error that results for each tuning parameter value.}
\item{bestsumabsv}{Value of sumabsv that resulted in lowest CV error.}
\item{nonzerovs}{Average number of non-zero elements of v for each candidate
value of sumabsvs.} \item{v.init}{Initial value of v that was passed in. Or,
if that was NULL, then first right singular vector of X.}
\item{bestsumabsv1se}{The smallest value of sumabsv that is within 1
standard error of smallest CV error.}
}
\description{
Selects tuning parameter for the sparse principal component analysis method
of Witten, Tibshirani, and Hastie (2008), which involves applying PMD to a
data matrix with lasso ($L_1$) penalty on the columns and no penalty on the
rows. The tuning parameter controls the sum of absolute values - or $L_1$
norm - of the elements of the sparse principal component.
}
\details{
This method only performs cross-validation for the first sparse principal
component. It does so by performing the following steps nfolds times: (1)
replace a fraction of the data with missing values, (2) perform SPC on this
new data matrix using a range of tuning parameter values, each time getting
a rank-1 approximationg $udv'$ where $v$ is sparse, (3) measure the mean
squared error of the rank-1 estimate of the missing values created in step
1.

Then, the selected tuning parameter value is that which resulted in the
lowest average mean squared error in step 3.

In order to perform cross-validation for the second sparse principal
component, apply this function to $X-udv'$ where $udv'$ are the output of
running SPC on the raw data $X$.

\examples{

#NOT RUN
## A simple simulated example
#set.seed(1)
#u <- matrix(c(rnorm(50), rep(0,150)),ncol=1)
#v <- matrix(c(rnorm(75),rep(0,225)), ncol=1)
#x <- u\%*\%t(v)+matrix(rnorm(200*300),ncol=300)
## Perform Sparse PCA - that is, decompose a matrix w/o penalty on rows
## and w/ L1 penalty on columns
## First, we perform sparse PCA and get 4 components, but we do not
## require subsequent components to be orthogonal to previous components
#cv.out <- SPC.cv(x, sumabsvs=seq(1.2, sqrt(ncol(x)), len=6))
#print(cv.out)
#plot(cv.out)
#out <- SPC(x,sumabsv=cv.out$bestsumabs, K=4) # could use
## cv.out$bestsumabvsv1se instead
#print(out,verbose=TRUE)
## Now, we do sparse PCA using method in Section 3.2 of WT&H(2008) for getting
## multiple components - that is, we require components to be orthogonal
#cv.out <- SPC.cv(x, sumabsvs=seq(1.2, sqrt(ncol(x)), len=6), orth=TRUE)
#print(cv.out)
#plot(cv.out)
#out.orth <- SPC(x,sumabsv=cv.out$bestsumabsv, K=4, orth=TRUE)
#print(out.orth,verbose=TRUE)
#par(mfrow=c(1,1))
#plot(out$u[,1], out.orth$u[,1], xlab="", ylab="")
